    <tr>
        <td width="80%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Dear Mom, <p>Our scout
        master told us all write to our parents in case you saw
        the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our
        tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none
        of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain
        looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call
        Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write
        because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search
        &amp; rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have
        found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.
        </p>
        <p>Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike
        alone with out telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him,
        but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him.
        Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can
        will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of
        our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to
        look weird until his hair grows back. We will be home on
        Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed.</p>
        <p>It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked
        OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that
        old you have to expect something to break down; that's
        probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's
        a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if
        it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It
        gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take
        turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman
        stopped and talked to us. </p>
        <p>Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a
        good driver. In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive.
        But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where
        there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are
        logging trucks. This morning all of the guys were diving
        off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster
        Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was
        afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us
        take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can
        still see some of the trees under the water from the
        flood. </p>
        <p>Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters.
        He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to
        spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying
        not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all
        passed our first aid merit badges. When Dave dove in the
        lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet
        works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it
        probably was just food poisoning from the leftover
        chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food
        they ate in prison. I'm so glad he got out and become our
        scoutmaster. He said he sure figured out how to get
        things done better while he was doing his time. I have to
        go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and
        buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.
        Love, Cole</p>
