are not playing to your best level of ability: one of those
nights, you know you can do better but nothing seems to work, and
you've tried &quot;everything&quot;. Someone tells you your
&quot;timing is off&quot; - what do they mean? </p>

<p>ASK THEM! As someone else once observed, your centre may only
have one or two qualified coaches but every league has at least
twenty!</p>

<p>People talk about &quot;timing&quot; all the time, some people
will try to change your timing - ask them to explain why they
want to do this. Just as you can fight with your style mentally,
if your timing is not right you will not be able to deliver the
ball well and may do physical damage to your body.</p>

<h2>Quantative Analysis</h2>

<p>When I talk about Timing what I refer to is the position of
the ball (swing) in relation to your position (step) in the
approach. Since we have people who use three, four, five, six
steps or even none (for wheelchair bowlers) I make measurements
at &quot;named positions&quot;, see the following diagram...</p>
<div align="center"><center>

a bowlers approach and timing</a></h5>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>Use of computerised video enables us to make accurate
measurements which become part of the athlete's Performance
Profile. This is, of course, for a hook bowler with a goal of
creating leverage in the Finish, the point of release.</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="2" cellspacing="1" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Balance Line</strong></td>
        <td>To create the Leverage needed to impart energy
        (&quot;revs&quot;) onto the ball in the Finishing
        position the athlete must maintain good balance
        throughout the approach. Bad timing will leave the bowler
        off balance and make it difficult for them to create
        leverage in the finish. By dropping a line (white) from
        the centre of gravity (CG: biomechanically, a point
        around the belly button) to the ground we are able to see
        if the bowler is balanced over the leading foot. In the
        finish the CG must be behind the leading foot. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Angle of Back</strong></td>
        <td>Fred Borden, in his classic &quot;Knowledge is the
        Key&quot; <a href="CBooks.Htm">book</a>, also studied
        video and recommended a constant 15-degree angle of the
        back from the Stance to the Finish. We draw a line (yellow)
        along the bowlers spine to measure this angle (from the
        vertical). As we see in the above diagram this bowler is
        breaking the rules, he's also won more tournaments than
        any other European bowler in recent years! This is a
        power stroker style. Like a cranker there is a &quot;pivot&quot;
        (increased lean) after the pro-zone (2nd in a four-step
        approach). This angle does, though, remain constant.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Angle of Swing</strong></td>
        <td>We also want to look at the swing, at several key
        points of the approach, as described below...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Push-Away</strong></td>
        <td>The swing starts with the push-away. When the weight
        transfers to the leading foot I measure the angle between
        the upper-arm and the fore-arm (green lines). A straight
        line (180-degrees) usually means good timing. A common
        problem for novice bowlers is holding on the ball too
        long: the angle here will be much less than 180 degrees.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Pro-Zone</strong></td>
        <td>Don Johnson (on his Better Bowling series of <a
        href="CVideos.Htm">videos</a>) also studied video and
        referred to the pro-zone where most professional bowlers
        had the ball on the 2nd step (3rd for five step approach).
        Measuring the angle between the swing (green) and the
        balance line (white) leads to a number which we can use
        to see whether the bowler is in time, early or late.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Pivot Step</strong></td>
        <td>This is the penultimate step, the point where the
        bowler must be in perfect balance to make a strong push
        off into the Finish. We check for two things here:
        balance over the leading foot and the angle of the
        backswing, looking for around a ninety-degree angle
        between arm (green) and spine (yellow). Late timing (which
        starts in the Push Away) usually shows up with a reduced
        backswing. As Don Johnson says, if you don't start well
        you can't finish well.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Slide</strong></td>
        <td>To create leverage the balance line must be behind
        the sliding foot. We get an indication of the leverage
        which can be created by measuring the angle between the
        arm and the vertical when the bowler pushes off into the
        slide. A roller will have &quot;perfect&quot; timing (small)
        angle while the more powerful bowlers will have more
        angle, right up to the &quot;plant-and-pull&quot; type <a
        href="tStyles.htm">crankers</a> - if the ball is already
        at the ankle they can't &quot;pull&quot; to generate that
        power in the release.</td>
