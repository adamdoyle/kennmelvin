<h2>Will my Compact Discs work in Australia?</h2>

<p>[Document Version: <b>1.00</b>] [Last Updated: <b>3/26/96</b>]
</p>

<p>People who read soc.culture.australian often have to answer a
number of questions about our country. These vary from the
practical (Will an American video recorder work with an
Australian TV? What voltage is used in Australia? What side of
the road to Australians drive on?) through to the curious (Does
water really go down the plughole in the opposite direction? What
does Vegemite taste like?), to the, well, fairly clueless.</p>

<p>Recently we had the following thread.</p>

<p>(I haven't asked the posters to this thread whether they mind
if I send it to rec.humor.funny, and I realise that these
extracts from posting are probably a bit long to come under 'fair
use'. I doubt if any of them would mind, but sorry if you can't
use this for copyright reasons).</p>

        am coming to Australia for a 3 year stay. Should I bring
        my CD's to play on Aussie equipment?</p>
        <p><strong>From Adrian Rose</strong></p>
        <p>You will need an American to Australian converter
        device. This is usually hard wired into the CD player by
        a reputable Australian tech. They are all familiar with
        the device. Just pop into any CD store and request the
        phone # of the nearest CD converter tech. Its usually
        only around $30 and you will not even know it had been
        done. You will be able to play not only US cds, and
        Australian, but as a bonus, European ones too!</p>
        <p>Caution-do not try to play bootled CDs after the
        conversion,you will ruin the cd player.</p>
        <p><strong>From Adrian Rose</strong></p>
        <p>Sorry about that last post-to play your US cds in
        Australia,they merely need to be passed thru a strong
        magnetic or x-ray field,such as you get at Customs.Be
        sure to pass each one thru separately,as bulk passage may
        leave the ones in the middle unplayable in Oz.</p>
        <p><strong>From Mark A. Gray</strong></p>
        <p>Well...this may gave worked for you, but I found that
        the only way the get 'em playing was to smear the shiny
        side with a very thin layer of vegemite. 'Course this
        makes the inside of your CD player rather sticky, so make
        sure you have lots of tissues.</p>
        <p><strong>From Hans Andersen</strong></p>
        <p>Don't listen to them. To play American CDs in
        Australian CD players, you will need to regroove them.
        This is because Australian CDs have a different track-width
        (i.e. 10 ums instead of 5 ums). To do this you will need
        to buy some fine-grade sandpaper. Try to find some with a
        grain size of between 8 and 12 ums (micrometers for non-technical
        people). Put a piece of the sandpaper on a table with the
        rough side up. Now put your CD on the sandpaper and turn
        it slowly in a clockwise direction, pushing down hard.
        Oiua la (spit) - now you have Australian standard CDs.</p>
        <p>Good luck and I hope you enjoy Australia.</p>
        <p><strong>From Michael Jennings</strong></p>
        <p>No. That is completely wrong. Australian CDs are
        exactly the same as American ones except for the fact
        that the 'groove' goes in the opposite direction. That is
        whereas an American groove goes inwards as you go
        clockwise an Australian groove goes inwards as you go
        anti-clockwise. This is because Australian cars drive on
        the left and American cars drive on the right. If the
        groove direction was not reversed there would be parity
        problems with car CD players. Unfortunately, this means
        that you cannot play an American CD on Australian
        equipment.</p>
        <p><strong>From Stephen P. Guthrie</strong></p>
        <p>You smartarse. Obviously this is nothing to do with
        the side of the road cars drive on. Do you seriously
        expect anyone to swallow that? Anyone with a brain knows
        that it's related to which direction water goes down the
        plughole in the Southern hemisphere. In other words in
        the US the cd rotates in a clockwise direction. In
        Australia it rotates anticlockwise. Of course this is
        also true if you play your cds in South America for
        example. This is actually quite neat because if you play
        your beatles cds in the Southern hemisphere you hear all
        this neat 'backwards masking' stuff about Paul being dead
        and taking marijuana. Also I heard that you hear all
        sorts of satanic stuff in other rock albums, but I'm not
        a fan myself. My question: has anyone done any experimets
        about playing cds at the equator or at the notrh pole? At
        the equator do your cds stop playing altogether. What
        about in a reduced gravity environment, like in a free
        faling elevator?</p>
        <p align="right"><a href="#Col2">Next Column</a></p>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><a name="Col2"><strong></strong></a><strong>From
        Mark A. Gray</strong><p>I can't speak for a reduced
        gravity environment, but I can speak for the equator. It
        is interesting that you should bring it up, since many
        CD's simply do not spin at the equator (or near it
        actually). In Singapore (for instance) they had to ban a
        whole bunch of CDs or have them altered so that they
        would play correctly ('corse if they had a bit of
        vegemite their problems would be solved). Video tapes and
        books(!) seem to suffer the same fate their. </p>
        <p>Why don't books work properly at the equator? And I
        have another question: Short of smearing every page with
        vegemite, how do you get a northern hemisphere book to
        work properly in the southern hemisphere? (I'll be
        bringing some books home with me when I leave here, so I
        need to know).</p>
        <p>Thanks in advance.</p>
        <p><strong>From Joe Chew</strong></p>
        <p>Since the Earth rotates in the opposite direction in
        the Southern Hemisphere, the AC power there is supplied
        180 degrees out of phase with ours. Thus your CD should
        work just fine, although some audio purists insist on a
        motor- generator set to supply &quot;American&quot;
        electricity and then determine the phasing themselves.</p>
        <p><strong>From Orion Auld</strong></p>
        <p>At the equator, the cd's stop rotating, so the cd
        players there must rotate the laser about the stationary
        cd. The units are very expensive.</p>
        <p>By contrast, at the north pole, cd players are very
        cheap. This is because neither the laser or the cd
        require a motor to provide rotational energy; the cd is
        placed precisely on the north pole, tied to the firmament
        so that it doesn't spin , while the laser is fixed to the
        earth, slightly off-center, and the earth provides the
        rotation.</p>
        <p>&gt;What about in a reduced gravity environment,<br>
        &gt;like in a free faling elevator?</p>
        <p>The cd's are virtually weightless, so they can be very
        massive and yet consumers will have little difficulty
        operating them. I hope that answers your question.</p>
        <p><strong>From Jim Gunson</strong></p>
        <p>I'm glad you brought this up. The variation of the
        Coriolis force with latitude (zero at equator, max at
        north pole, min at south pole), gives rise to the so-called
        beta effect. Basically what happens is that when a
        clockwise-spinning object, in the northern hemisphere,
        moves north it speeds up, when it moves southe it slows
        down. I've conducted experiments whilst driving my car
        here in Boston: if I head north on route 93 at 75 mph
        with Kylie's &quot;Locomotion&quot; on the CD player, the
        pitch of her voice goes higher, but you have to be going
        pretty fast to notice this. Heading west or east this
        doesn't happen. To the original poster, if you do find
        you're having trouble with the Coriolis force adversely
        affecting your US cd's in australia, try turning the cd
        player upside-down.</p>
        <p><strong>From Adrian Rose</strong></p>
        <p>No, no, no...................please dont confuse the
        Coriols effect with the Doppler effect-the two are quite
        unrelated, and the Doppler effect is ALMOST unnoticeable,
        when playing out-of-area CDs,or even records.</p>
        <p>The effect was most noticeable on 78's,but that's now
        academic.</p>
        <p>BTW,I am able to offer the conversion at only 75cents
        (us),if done in bulk. E-mail for quotes.</p>
        <p><strong>From PHolman1</strong></p>
        <p>No if regrooved in the N Hemisphere the must be spun
        counterclockwise, remember Aussie turntables etc spin the
        opposite way, ps Marmite works as well as Vegimite. </p>
        <p><strong>From Armadillo</strong></p>
        <p>No, American compact discs will only work if you drive
        on the right-hand side of the road. But I wouldn't expect
        an aol.com user to know these things.</p>
