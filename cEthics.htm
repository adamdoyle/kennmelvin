        can contribute positively to the development of
        individuals. It is a vehicle for physical, mental,
        personal, social and emotional development. Such
        development is enhanced if the individual is guided by an
        informed, thinking, caring and enlightened coach
        operating within an accepted ethical framework as a self-monitoring
        professional.</p>
        <p>It is important to establish, publicise and maintain
        standards of ethical behaviour in coaching practise, and
        to inform and protect members of the pubic using the
        services of sports coaches. Key principles of
        responsibility and competence provide the core values of
        good coaching and the framework of this document.</p>
        <p>This code has been developed from the Code of Ethics (1989)
        published by the British Institute of Sports Coaches (BISC).
        It also adopts the principles contained in the Council of
        Europe;s Code of Sports Ethics. The BISC Code formed the
        value statement underpinning the National Vocational
        Qualification Standards (1992) for Coaching, Teaching and
        Instructing. It is anticipated that this revised version
        will replace the original BISC Code as the NVQ value
        statement.</p>
        <p>The code is a framework from within which to work. It
        is a series of guidelines rather than a set of
        instructions, and should be used in conjunction with
        other National Coaching Foundation publications (eg
        Working with Children, The Coach in Action, Protecting
        Children: a guide for sportspeople) and any comparable
        publications produced by the national governing bodies of
        sport.</p>

<h2>Section B: Principles</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Sports coaches are expected to conform to ethical standards in
a number of areas: humanity, relationships, commitment, co-operation,
integrity, advertising, confidentiality, abuse of privilege and
personal standards.</p>

<h3>Humanity</h3>

<p>Coaches must respect the rights, dignity and worth of every
human being and their ultimate right to self-determination.
Specifically, coaches must treat everyone equitably and
sensitively, within the context of their activity and ability,
regardless of gender, ethnic origin, cultural background, sexual
orientation, religion or political affiliation.</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>The good coach will be concerned primarily with the well-being,
safety, protection and future of the individual performer. There
must be a balance between the development of performance and the
social, emotional, intellectual and physical needs of the
individual.</p>

<p>A key element in a coaching relationship is the development of
independence. Performers must be encouraged and guided to accept
responsibility for their own behaviour and performance in
training, in competition, and in domestic, academic or business
life.</p>

<p>Coaches are responsible for setting and monitoring the
boundaries between a working relationship and friendship with
their performers. This is particularly important when the
performer is a young person. The coach must realise that certain
situations or friendly words and actions could be misinterpreted,
not only by the performer, but also by outsiders (or other
members of a squad or group of performers) motivated by jealousy,
dislike or mistrust, and could lead to allegations of misconduct
or impropriety.</p>

<p>Where physical contact between coach and performer is a
necessary part of the coaching process, coaches must ensure that
no action on their part could be misconstrued and that any NGB
guidelines on this matter are followed.</p>

<p>The relationship between coach and performer relies heavily on
mutual trust and respect. This means that the performer should be
made aware of the coach&#146;s qualifications and experience, and
must be given the opportunity to consent to or decline proposals
for training, performance or competition.</p>

<h3>Commitment</h3>

<p>Coaches should clarify in advance with performers (and/or
employers) the number of sessions, fees (if any) and method of
payment. They should explore with performers (and/or employers)
the expectation of the outcome of coaching. Written contracts may
be appropriate in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Coaches have a responsibility to declare to their performers
and/or employers any other current coaching commitments. They
should also find out if any prospective client is receiving
instruction from another teacher/coach. If so, the teach/coach
should be contacted to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>Coaches who become aware of a conflict between their
obligation to their performers and their obligation to their NGB
(or other organisation employing them), must make explicit to all
parties concerned the nature of the conflict, and the loyalties
and responsibilities involved.</p>

<p>Coaches should expect a similar level of reciprocal commitment
from their performers. In particular the performer (parent/guardian
in the case of a minor) should inform the coach of any change in
circumstances that might affect the coach/performer relationship.</p>

<p>Coaches should receive appropriate acknowledgement for their
contribution to the performer&#146;s progress and achievement.
Where money is earned from performances, it is reasonable to
expect the coach should receive an appropriate share of the
rewards. Such apportionment with any attendant conditions should
be agree in advance (in writing) to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>

<h3>Co-operation</h3>

<p>Coaches should communicate and co-operate with other sports
and allied professions in the best interest of their performers.
An example of such contact could be the seeking of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Educational and career counselling for young performers
        whose involvement in sport impinges upon their studies</li>
    <li>Sport science advice through the British Association of
        Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES).</li>
</ul>

<p>Coaches must communicate and co-operate with registered
medical and ancillary practitioners in the diagnosis, treatment
and management of their performers&#146; medical and
psychological problems,</p>

<h3>Integrity</h3>

<p>Coaches must not encourage performers to violate the rules of
their sport. They should actively seek to discourage and condemn
such action and encourage performers to obey the spirit of the
rules.</p>

<p>Coaches must not compromise their performers by advocating
measures which could constitute unfair advantage. They must not
adopt practises to accelerate performance improvement which might
jeapordise the safety, total well-being and future participation
of the performer. Coaches must never advocate or condone the use
of prohibited drugs or other banned performance enhancing
substances.</p>

<p>Coaches must ensure that the activities, training and
competition programmes they advocate and direct are appropriate
for the age, maturity, experience and ability of the indvidual
performer.</p>

<p>Coaches must treat opponents with due respect, both in victory
and defeat, and should encourage their performers to act in a
similar manner. A key role for a coach is to prepare performers
to respond to success and failure in a dignified manner.</p>

<p>Coaches must accept responsibility for the conduct of their
performers and discourage inappropriate behaviour in training,
competition, and away from the sporting arena.</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>

<p>Advertising by sports coaches in respect of qualifications,
training and/or services must be accurate and professionally
restrained. Coaches must be able to present evidence of current
qualifications upon request. Evidence should also be available to
support any claim associated with the promotion of their services.</p>

<p>Coaches must not display any affiliation with an organisation
in a manner that falsely implies sponsorship or accreditation by
that organisation.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>

<p>Sports coaches inevitably gather a great deal of personal
information about performers in the course of a working
relationship. Coach and performer must reach agreement about what
is to be regarded as confidential information (ie not divulged to
a third party without the express approval of the performer).</p>

<p>Confidentiality does not preclude the disclosure of
information about a performer to person who can be judged to have
a right to know. For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Evaluation for competitive selection purposes.</li>
    <li>Recommendations for employment.</li>
    <li>In pursuit of disciplinary action involving performers
        within the sport.</li>
    <li>In pursuit of disciplinary action by a sports
        organisation against one of its members.</li>
    <li>Legal and medical requirements for disclosure.</li>
    <li>Recommendations to parents/family where the health and
        safety of performers might be at stake.</li>
    <li>In pursuit of action to protect children from abuse.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Abuse of privilege</h3>

<p>The sports coach is privileged to have regular contact with
performers and occasionally to travel and reside with performers
in the course of coaching and competitive practise. A coach must
not attempt to exert undue influence over the performer in order
to obtain personal benefit or reward.</p>

<h3>Personal Standards</h3>

<p>Coaches must consistently display high standards and project a
favourable image of their sport and of coaching to performers,
their parents/families, other coaches, officials, spectators, the
media and the general public.</p>

<p>Personal appearance is a matter of individual taste but the
sports coach has an obligation to project and image of health,
cleanliness and functional efficiency.</p>

<p>Sports coaches should never smoke whilst coaching.</p>

<p>Coaches should not drink alcohol so soon before coaching that
it would affect their competence to coach, compromise the safety
of the performers or obviously indicate they had been drinking (eg
smell of alcohol on breath).</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>Within the limits of their control, coaches have a
responsibility to ensure as far as possible the safety of the
performers with whom they work.</p>

<p>All reasonable steps should be take to establish a safe
working environment.</p>

<p>The work done and the manner in which it is done should be in
keeping with the regular and approved practise with their sport
as determined by the NGB.</p>

<p>The activity undertaken should be suitable for the age,
physical and emotional maturity, experience and ability of the
performers.</p>

<p>Coaches have a duty to protect children from harm and abuse.</p>

<p>The performers should have been systematically prepared for
the activity and made aware of their personal responsibilities in
terms of safety.</p>

<p>Coaches should arrange adequate insurance to cover all aspects
of their coaching practise.</p>

<h3>Competence</h3>

<p>Coaches shall confine themselves to practise in those elements
of sport for which their training and competence is recognised by
the appropriate NGB. Training include the accumulation of
knowledge and skills through formal coach education courses,
independent research and the accumulation of relevent verifiable
expereience.</p>

<p>The National Vocational Qualification standards for coaching,
teaching and instructing (and/or the approved NGB coaching awards)
provide the framework for assessing competence at the different
levels of coaching practise. Competence to coach should normally
be verified through evidence of qualifications. Competence cannot
be inferred solely from evidence of prior experience.</p>

<p>Coaches must be able to recognise and accept when to refer
performers to other coaches or agencies. It is their
responsibility, as far as possible, to verify the competence and
integrity of any other person to whom they refer a performer.</p>

<p>Coaches should regularly seek ways of increasing their
personal and professional development.</p>

<p>Coaches should welcome evaluation of their work by colleagues
and be able to account to performers, employers, NGBs and
colleagues for what they do and why.</p>

<p>Coaches hav a responsibility to themselves and their
performers to maintain their own effectiveness, resilience and
abilities. They should recognise when their personal resource are
so depleted that help is needed. This may necessitate the
withdrawal from coaching temporarily or permanently.</p>

<h2>Section C: Conduct for Members of the National Association of
Sports Coaches (NASC)</h2>

<ol>
    <li>This section is specifically for members of the NCF&#146;s
        National Association of Sports Coaches (NASC). It
        provides more specific information and guidance about the
        implementation of the principles embodied in Section B.
        National governing bodies and other organisations may
        wish to adapt this section to meet their own needs.</li>
    <li>NASC coaches shall adhere at all times to standards of
        personal and professional behaviour which reflect credit
        on themselves, their employers, their national governing
        body, the National Coaching Foundation and the whole
        process and practise of sports coaching.</li>
    <li>It is impossible to specify precisely all those actions
        which could be deemed to be prejudicial to such standards.
        The following paragraphs provide an indication of the
        types of incident that are likely to be considered as
        breaches of this section of the Code:</li>
</ol>

<h3>Public criticism of colleagues</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Coaches should refrain from public criticism of fellow
        members of NASC. Public in this context means criticism
        expressed in any branch of the media or in a lecture or
        seminar. Any such pubic criticism of a fellow member will
        be regards as a prima facie breach of this code and may
        be subject to disciplinary action.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Misrepresentation (reference 30,31,46 and 48 in Section B)</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Coaches must ensure they do not in any way misrepresent
        their qualifications, affiliations or professional
        competence to any client or prospective client or in any
        publication, broadcast, lecture or seminar.
        Misrepresentation will be regarded as a serious breach of
        this code.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Commitment (reference 18 in Section B)</h3>

<p>When coaches enter into a commitment with an employer, a team,
or an individual performer, the nature of that commitment should
be specifically agreed. Any such contract or terms of reference
should be set out in writing and include fees (if any) and method
of payment, the time commitment involved, and an indication of
the expected outcome of the coaching.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality (reference 33 in Section B)</h3>

<p>Coaches must not divulge confidential information relating to
a performer, other than that specified in Section B (32 and 33)
to any third party unless with the express approval of the
performer concerned. In the storage and disposal of personal
records coaches should be aware of the requirements of the Data
Protection Act. An individual performer must be allowed
reasonable access to their personal data records held by a coach.</p>

<h3>Criminal Conviction </h3>

<p>Any conviction of a sports coach by a court of law is capable
of reflecting adversely on the profession. Cases of minor
personal nature are unlikely to be regarded as breaches of this
code but all reported cases will be considered. Members of the
NASC must report any alleged criminal offence to the National
Coaching Foundations at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h3>Disciplinary proceedings by and employer</h3>

<p>Disciplinary proceedings by an employer leading to dismissal
from employment connected with sports coaching will normally be
regarded as a breach of this code. This applies even if the coach
has been involved in related court proceedings which have not
resulted in conviction. Other disciplinary proceedings by an
employer (eg reprimand) will not normally be considered as a
breach of this code unless the circumstances are sufficient to
found a complaint under another section.</p>

<p>Members of NASC must report to the National Coaching
Foundation any formal disciplinary action taken against them by
an employer in connection with their workd as a sports coach.</p>

<h3>Personal misconduct</h3>

<p>Personal misconduct by members of NASC may still give rise to
disciplinary action by the National Coaching Foundation if such
conduct is deemed to be misconduct or gross misconduct, even if
such misconduct does not give rise to disciplinary proceedings by
an employer or lead to conviction in a court of law. The
following examples are not exhaustive or exclusive:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Misconduct (eg bad timekeeping, unreasonable or
        unexplained absence, lack of application, damage to
        property or equipment, breach of NASC rules).</li>
    <li>Gross misconduct (eg theft, falsification of reports or
        accounts, breach of confidentiality, violence, misuse of
        alcohol or drugs, dishonesty, sexual harassment or abuse,
        indecency, any form of child abuse).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Complaints procedures</h3>

<p>Any individual or organisation wishing to make a complaint
against a sports coach within the context of this code should
follow this procedure:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Report the matter to the employer of the sports coach and
        to the national governing body responsible for that sport.</li>
    <li>NB Employer in this instance refers to the organisation
        who commissioned the coach to do the coaching whether
        this is paid or unpaid employment. This might be a club,
        NGB or local authority.</li>
    <li>Complaints which refer to abuse of children should also
        be referred to the police and Social Services. For
        further help contact the NSPCC helpline 0800 800500.</li>
    <li>If the coach in question is known to be a member of NASC
        or if no satisfaction is obtained from the complaint to
        the employer and governing body, then the matter should
        be reported to the National Coaching Founation, 114
        Cardigan Road, Leeds LS6 3BJ tel:0113 274 4802.</li>
    <li>On receipt of such a complaint, detailed procedural
        guidelines will be issued to all parties concerned.</li>
</ul>
