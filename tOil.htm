<h6>Revised April 15th 2000</h6>

<h3>Flat Oil, A little History<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
height="3"></h3>

<p>The simplest pattern is &quot;flat oil&quot;: the oil is
applied in equal measure across the width of the lane. In the
very early days of bowling this oil (which was actually &quot;shellac&quot;)
would be applied for the full length of the lane. After World War
II lacquer was used and, again, this was applied for the full
length of the lane. In the 1960's a urethane based finish was
developed, but this &quot;migrated&quot; - was picked up by the
ball and got into the pinsetting machinery causing problems -
hence a &quot;limited dressing&quot; procedure was adoped where
the final few feet of the lane (the &quot;back-end&quot;) were
kept dry. This history is repeated in many other places, and I'm
not going to repeat what others do better: if you want to learn
more I'd refer you to Tom Kouros' <a href="cBooks.htm">Par
Bowling</a>.</p>

<p><img src="tHook.jpg"
alt="Picture of bowling ball hooking on the back-end of a bowling lane"
align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="225" height="222">Oil
is clearly a &quot;slippery&quot; substance and the back-end,
being free of oil, creates greater friction between the ball and
the lane. This friction creates the potential for added hook and
more angle of entry into the pocket to carry strikes (read more
about <a href="tHook.htm">hook</a> bowling). On a flat condition
the length of the oil governs when the ball will start to hook:
so a short-oil condition will play differently than a long-oil
lane. Now, because the oil is not <a href="tOilGlow.htm">visible</a>
to the human eye, we enter the complex domain of Lane-Play, where
skilled bowlers solve the puzzle of how best to play a lane by <a
href="tArse.htm">adjusting</a> Angle, Release, Speed and
Equipment. A big hook is exciting but can be hard to control too.
Many have commented that complaining about lane conditions
started to escalate after the big back-end developed.</p>

<h3>Crowns &amp; Reverse Blocks<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
height="3"></h3>

<p>Flat oil is simple, but because the balls move the oil around,
picking it up and depositing it further down the lane (as &quot;carrydown&quot;)
a dried out track can start to develop. In open-play many
straight bowlers also roll balls right down the middle part of
the lane, creating a condition known as a reverse block (dried up
in the middle and oiled on the outside of the lane). The reverse
block is not normally created deliberately and is very hard to
play. So, to combat the open-play syndrome proprietors will put
more oil in the middle part of the lane. Viewed in a side-profile
this pattern resembles a &quot;crown&quot;.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tOilRev.jpg"

<h3>Walls, Blocks &amp; Top Hats<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
height="3"></h3>

<p>Remember that friction creates the potential for hook. A dry
back-end allows the ball to hook in the latter part of the lane.
In leagues in many parts of the USA it was common to apply oil
only to the middle part of the lane, leaving both the back-end
and the outside boards dry. Usually the oil is applied 10-10. </p>

<p>This lack of oil on the outside created a wall of friction,
what some people mockingly call &quot;adult bumper bowling&quot;:
if a hook bowler missed the target a few boards to the outside
the extra friction in that part of the lane would bring the ball
back - on flat oil it would probably slide on, or even off the
edge of the lane! A wall is clearly a very high scoring shot and
proprietors favoured this for leagues, but, ask yourself, do you
prefer artificially inflated high scores on such an easy
condition, with the &quot;bumpers&quot; up? For a casual/social
league that's fine, but removing the skill of lane play and
reducing it to one of equipment selection is not good for the
sport. To restore the integrity of the game and bring respect
back to skilled bowlers the wall is not a desirable condition.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tOilWall.jpg"

vspace="2" width="600" height="100"></p>

<p>The ABC (American Bowling Congress) ruled that no sanctioned
event could have fewer than 3 &quot;units&quot; of oil across the
width of the lane. The International governing body (the FIQ)
version of this rule requires a minimum of 5 units.</p>

<h3>Christmas Trees<br>
<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%" height="3"></h3>

<p>At the time of writing the Christmas Tree is thought to be the
fairest possible condition. Because there are different <a
href="tStyles.htm">styles</a> of players using a single condition
could easily be unfair to one particular style and many bowlers
have felt 'victimised' by the lanesman's choice of condition for
a tournament. The Christmas Tree tries to cater to all styles,
allowing the cranker to move inside and swing the ball out to the
break point while, at the other extreme, the low-rev hook bowler
can play up the outside lines.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="tOilXmas.jpg"

<h3>A Fair Shot?<br>
<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%" height="3"></h3>

<p>Is there such a thing. The general concensus is No. The
Christmas tree is probably the single fairest condition, in that
it tries to allow all <a href="tStyles.htm">styles</a> to compete
but highly aggressive bowling balls can lift oil off the lane at
such a rate that the condition that is put out in the morning can
change dramatically within a few games. It's often said that a
good bowler can adjust to any lane condition, but with the
realisation that this means certain styles don't have to adjust
to certain conditions some people are now advocating that we stop
pursuing the holy-grail of a single &quot;fair&quot; condition.
Instead, they say, a tournament should be played on multiple
conditions so that all styles have to adjust and at the end of
the day the best bowlers are recognised.</p>
