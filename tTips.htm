<p>As a coach I get lots of questions. Diagnosing problems over
the internet is not easy but I don't mind if you want to email me
with your questions. If you have ever called a technical support
helpline for a problem with your computer or other such device,
though, you'll know that the person at the other line has to
systematically ask you a list of questions to diagnose the
problem. This systematic approach takes a little longer than
recommending quick fixes, but in the long run gets to the right
solution. Think about it for a minute, even if I could see you
bowl there is no simple magical &quot;tip&quot; I could give you
to make you a great bowler: the bottom line is that it takes
practise.</p>

<p>Below you'll find a list of tips that I recommend. So, if you
have a question, feel free to send me <a
href="mailto:GetACoach@yahoo.com">e-mail</a> (read the kind of <a
href="tTipNote.htm">information</a> that you can include in such
a note).</p>

<h2>My Bowling Tips</h2>

<p>The table below lists some general tips that are applicable to
all levels of players. In brief, if your average is less than 180
you are missing spares - you need to work on your physical game,
develop more consistency and learn some simple spare shooting
systems: buying an expensive new ball is not the answer and may
compound your problems. When you average over 180,190 and above
your physical game is good and you can make your spares: you need
to find the line faster so you can string strikes together on any
lane, with any condition and do it under pressure - you need to
develop your Mental skills, your ability to play different lane
conditions and match equipment to those conditions.</p>

        Get a Coach</strong></td>
        <td class="oddLine">That's my email address, and I mean
        it. If you want to get better find a certified coach to
        help you. Whether you are just starting and want to find
        a house ball that fits or are competing at international
        level there is no substitute for one on one coaching: if
        the PBA players have coaches there is no reason why you
        shouldn't either. Don't be afraid to move on to another
        coach as you get better, that's natural progression, or
        change if the first coach you get doesn't help you the
        way you want. You may not have such a person in your
        area, so ask a friend to help you work on your game. Two
        heads are better than one and the other pair of eyes will
        see things you can't.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="evenLine"><strong>#2. Get A Good
        Fit</strong></td>
        <td class="evenLine">Your bowling ball has to fit your
        hand. See a good pro-shop operator (IBPSIA certified when
        possible). When you get a coach they may well do this as
        step one because, if your ball does not fit well, you
        will - without thinking - squeeze the ball to hold on,
        tensing up your muscles, or avoid a movement which causes
        some pain. This will hinder your ability to do what your
        coach is recommending. In extreme cases you may injure
        yourself. Sports injuries are too common and getting your
        ball checked by a certified pro-shop operator is a simple
        step to take to avoid such pain.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="oddLine"><strong>Get a Plan</strong></td>
        <td class="oddLine">With your coach you can profile your
        current level of ability and come up with <a
        href="tGoals.htm">goals</a> that will a) motivate you to
        practise and b) make the best use of your available time
        by working on the elements of your game which yield the
        best improvement. Working without a well formulated plan
        can be frustrating and lead to slumps but success, when
        you achieve the goals, is great for your confidence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="evenLine"><strong>Get a Life</strong></td>
        <td class="evenLine">There is more to life than money,
        winning and bowling. Bowling should be a part of your
        life. When you start to think that winning is everything,
        that you are out to &quot;beat&quot; the other person you
        are, in my opinion, going down the wrong road. Only time
        will tell.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="oddLine"><strong>Practise</strong></td>
        <td class="oddLine">There really is no such thing as a
        free lunch. See above: when you have a plan, goals, you
        have something to work towards and practise can be fun.
        Develop your Mental as well as your Physical skills. You
        have to put the practise into play, too: enter
        tournaments and push yourself to higher levels by playing
        with as bowlers of a higher standard.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="evenLine"><strong>Never stop
        learning</strong></td>
        <td class="evenLine">No one person can ever knows it all,
        when you think you do you'll get a nasty shock. Talk to
        as many people as you can, ask them questions and learn
        from them. Things change all the time. Nothing is cast in
        stone. Watch, listen, learn. Watch other sports: golf,
        basketball, whatever you like: how do the stars cope. Be
        open minded to new ideas, not dismissive and judgemental.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="oddLine"><strong>KISS </strong></td>
        <td class="oddLine">Keep It Simple Stupid! Sometimes we
        make things too hard, chill out, stand back and ask
        yourself simple questions: here's whats happenning,
        here's what could be causing this to happen, which of
        these things should I try to address. It's not magic. Buy
        a plastic ball and throw straight for <a
        href="tSystems.htm">spares</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="evenLine"><strong>Have Fun!</strong></td>
        <td class="evenLine">If you work all week why would you
        want to be frustrated in the bowling centre, you want to
        enjoy your bowling. If you follow the simple steps above
        you can improve your game, achieve goals, compete and get
        great satisfaction. You only get one shot at life, enjoy
        it while you can. </td>
