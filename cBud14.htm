<h1>The Fourteen Precepts</h1>

<p align="left" class="LeadIn">Ethics are taught both in the
business world and in the coaching arena. These fourteen
principles spell out a good philosophy that coaches could do well
to adapt. Some of the ideas are very deep, passing on much good
learning.</p>

    <tr>
        <td width="80%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h3>The First Precept<img
        src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%" height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine,
        theory, or ideology, even Buddhist ones. All systems of
        thought are guiding means: they are not absolute truth.</p>
        <h3>The Second Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not think the knowledge you presently possess is
        changeless, absolute truth. Avoid being narrow-minded and
        bound to present views. Learn and practice non-attachment
        from views in order to be open to receive others'
        viewpoints. Truth is found in life and not merely in
        conceptual knowledge. Be ready to learn throughout your
        entire life and to observereality in yourself and in the
        world at all times.</p>
        <h3>The Third Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not force others, including children, by any means
        whatsoever,to adopt your views, whether by authority,
        threat, money, propaganda or even education. However,
        through compassionate dialogue, help others renounce
        fanaticism and narrowness.</p>
        <h3>The Fourth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not avoid contact with suffering or close your eyes
        before suffering. Do not lose awareness of the existence
        of suffering in the life of the world. Find ways to be
        with those who are suffering by all means, including
        personal contact and visits, images, sounds. By such
        means, awaken yourself and others to the reality of
        suffering in the world.</p>
        <h3>The Fifth Precept:<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not accumulate wealth while millions are hungry. Do
        not take as the aim of your life fame, profit, wealth or
        sensual pleasure. Live simply and share time, energy and
        material resources with those who are in need.</p>
        <h3>The Sixth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not maintain anger or hatred. As soon as anger and
        hatred arise, practice the meditation on compassion in
        order to deeply understandthe persons who have caused
        anger and hatred. Learn to look at other beings with the
        eyes of compassion.</p>
        <h3>The Seventh Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not lose yourself in dispersion and in your
        surroundings. Learn to practice breathing in order to
        regain composure of the body andmind, to practice
        mindfullness and to develop concentration and
        understanding.</p>
        <h3>The Eighth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not utter words which can create discord and cause
        the community to break. Make every effort to reconcile
        and resolve all conflicts,however small.</p>
        <h3>The Ninth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not say untrue things for the sake of personal
        interest or to impress people. Do not utter words that
        cause division and hatred. Do not spread news that you do
        not know to be certain. Do not critize or condemn things
        that you are not sure of. Always speak truthfully and
        constructively. Have the courage to speak out about
        situations of injustice, even when doing so may threaten
        your own safety.</p>
        <h3>The Tenth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not use the Buddhist community for personal gain or
        profit, or transform your community into a political
        party. A religious community, however, should take a
        clear stand against oppression and injustice and should
        strive to change the situation without engaging in
        partisan conflicts.</p>
        <h3>The Eleventh Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG"
        width="80%" height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not live with a vocation which is harmful to humans
        and nature. Do not invest in companies that deprive
        others of their chance to live. Select a vocation which
        helps realize your ideal of compassion.</p>
        <h3>The Twelfth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%"
        height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not kill. Do not let others kill. Find whatever
        means possible to protect life and to prevent war.</p>
        <h3>The Thirteenth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG"
        width="80%" height="3"></h3>
        <p>Possess nothing that should belong to others. Respect
        the propertyof others, but prevent others from enriching
        themselves from human suffering or the suffering of other
        beings.</p>
        <h3>The Fourteenth Precept<img src="bgNavyH.JPG"
        width="80%" height="3"></h3>
        <p>Do not mistreat your body. Learn to handle it with
        respect. Do not look on your body as only an instrument.
        Preserve vital energies (sexual, breath, spirit) for the
        realization of the Way. Sexual expression should not
        happen without love and commitment. In sexual
        relationships, be aware of future suffering that may be
        caused. To preserve the happiness of others, respect the
        rights and commitments of others. Be fully aware of the
        responsibility of bringing new lives into the world.
        Meditate on the world into which you are bringing new
        beings.</p>
