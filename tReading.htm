<h1>Reading Lanes</h1>

<p class="LeadIn">
<span class="myCapital">H</span>ow to read lanes. 
This is probably the most frequently asked question by aspiring bowlers.
Should I buy a new ball; where should I stand; why does my ball roll out?
There are many aspects to "reading" lanes and we will share with you our 
simple method of tackling this problem.  If you can learn to read lanes
faster you will enjoy your bowling more and be more competitive against
those that don't have this skill.
</p>

<p>Firstly, ask look at the lane: how can you read it?  If you really know
your bowling you may be able to see a little oil, or identify the type of
lane surface but most people can't see the oil in the heads, let alone at
30,40 or 50 feet down the lane, or the small variations in crosswise tilt
which are also important.  What matters for you, the bowler, is not the lane
itself, but the ball reaction.  Human senses provide feedback and in bowling
we use our sight: we can see what the ball does - so it is ball reaction that
we learn to read, not the lanes themselves.</p>

<p>Through a process of Pattern Recognition you developed an awareness of 
good and bad ball reaction.  Muscle memory is important because it is automatic,
you don't need to think about the mechanics skills, they just happen - after
you have trained your body through repetition.  The same with reading ball
reaction: it's hard at first, but you learn to "see" the shot and will 
immediately know, without thinking, when the pattern changes: your brain
is happy in it's comfort zone and any variation will signal it fast.</p>

<p>Both hook and spinner bowlers can read the ball reaction through the
breakpoint.  These styles and straight bowlers can also learn to "read"
the signals that the pins give us too: e.g. 4 pin, 10 pin, 5 pin etc. etc.

<p>This is where you need to learn to read the lanes, or as I prefer to
say, read the reaction.  There is no one single solution.  Firstly I
can't see you bowl to see the reaction you get but, even if I could,
the center could oil the lanes different tomorrow and you would get a
different reaction.</p>

<p>There are many variables: oil pattern, games played (and their affect
on the oil), your style, the weather (hot, cold), condition of the lane
(each lane is different, esp on wood), consistency of your release etc.
etc.

<p>If you are using a wrist guard I assume you are playing hook style.  If
your ball does not flare watch the finger tips as the ball rolls down
the lane and learn to get a feel for when the ball hooks (the
breakpoint - watch the video of the soccer ball on my site to see this
in action).  Then when you can see that (it takes time to learn this
skill) you will "see" (without thinking) the breakpoint - you can then
judge whether the ball is hooking too early, too late or just right.  

<p>If the ball flare it gets a little harder to judge, but you can still
develop this feel, based on ball reaction.  Note this is not reading
lanes, but watching ball reaction - get the idea?  Your feedback comes
from what you can see the ball doing, you can't see the oil on the
lanes (especially 40-50-60 feet away).

<[>The adjustments you make are based on this breakpoint: if the ball
hooks too early it uses the energy up too soon and rolls out - you need
more speed, a shinier less aggressive ball, more oil, more axis
rotation/tilt.  If the ball skids too much, hooks too late and isn't
rolling at the pins you need an earlier reaction (simple, yeh?) so use
less speed, less rotation, more ball surface (duller, more aggressive)
and move to find less oil.

<p>All these adjustments are summarised in the simple phrase: <a href="tArse.htm">ARSE</a>, 
Angle,
Rotation, Speed and Equipment.  If the ball doesn't react as best it
the usual adjustments are a) to change Angle, moving in usually gets a
little more oil and more skid/distance b) change Equipment, use duller
higher friction surface for earlier roll.  Better bowlers can change
the speed and rotation too.

<p>So, how do you play wood?  Watch, look, observe and get a feel for the
ball reaction: when it's good remember it, when it's bad ask yourself
how it's different - does the ball break too soon or too late.  Then
use ARSE to make the adjustment which will best affect the reaction.

<p>Does that help a little?
