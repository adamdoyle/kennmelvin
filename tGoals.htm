<p>You want to get better, but if you keep doing what you're
doing now you're not going to get better. So what are you going
to change? Good use of goal setting can both identify the best
way and to develop the plans to help you improve your game. You
will achieve the results you desire increasing your confidence,
motivation and enjoyment of your sport.</p>

<h2>Where do you want to go?</h2>

<p><strong>&quot;If you don't know where you are going how will
you know when you get there?&quot;.</strong> This famous quote
pretty well sums it all up. To bowl each week without a purpose
is pretty pointless: well, ok, if your goal is simply to have a
night out of the house you'll probably be happy enough. But, if
you want to get better, to win leagues or travel and compete
successfully in tournaments please read on...</p>

<h3>Profiling</h3>

<p>To get better you must first take note of your current ability.
People sometimes cope with their problems by denying they exist (see
article on <a href="mAttitud.htm">Attitude</a>): you need to
admit, to yourself, your weak points. This can be done on your
own, but works best with a training partner or coach. Make a
start by systematically breaking down your game into it's
component elements. For example...</p>

<p>You can, of course, break these elements down into sub-elements
- for example, the physical game could be broken into timing,
ball speed, rev-rate, 10-pin conversion percentage etc.(the key
here is be specific and objective). In the example above both
coach and player already agree that the physical, lane-play and
equipment elements are strong and the main area to focus
development on, for this player, is the mental game. It may be
the case that the coach and player differ on their ratings, this
should be discussed to clarify the difference.</p>

<p>After a few weeks working on your goals you can look back at
your progress and see improvement. This positive feedback will
improve your motivation and confidence. Alternatively, if you are
not improving it is a sign that, for some reason, the training
methods are not working. Without a systematic approach 'failure'
normally is a strong demotivator but, here, you are being
objective, positive and forward-looking so you can quickly
respond to the lack of measurable improvement to adapt your
training programme.</p>

<h3>Goal Setting</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top">Having identified areas to work on you
        need, now, to distinguish between the results you want
        and the methods you will use to achieve them. Both of
        these (results/methods) can be goals: confused? Call them
        Long-Term and Short-Term goals and you should understand
        better. The long-term goals are what you want to achieve
        (perhaps many months or years away) and the short-term
        goals are things you need to achieve (in the coming weeks
        and months) to get there. Smaller, shorter improvements
        are more realistic.<p>It is important that your goals are
        exciting enough to motivate you to train harder, but the
        short-term goals are realistic enough that a failure to
        achieve them will result in major demotivation. Use the
        &quot;SMARTER&quot; acronymn in the table on the right to
        help you set goals.</p>
        <p>Remember the &quot;realistic&quot; component in your
        checklist and consider your life outside the bowling
        center - ask yourself if there are any &quot;barriers&quot;
        that might prevent you reaching the goals you have chosen.
        Such barriers might be money related, time you need
        balance between work, family and practise etc.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td>Goal setting is a tool that you can use as part of
        your life outside of sport. You have aspirations to get
        better, to achieve things but - with work, family, study
        needs - only a limited amount of time to do the work. The
        environment is, by it's very nature, competitive, so you
        need to make the best use of your valuable time.
        Profiling is a systematic way of analysing your current
        performance, so you know your strengths and weaknesses.
        With the help of a coach you can then set the long-term
        &quot;results&quot; you want to achieve and set short-term
        &quot;process&quot; goals with deadlines to gradually and
        realistically work towards them. Goal setting can help
        motivate yourself to train so that you achieve the
        results you want. These prioritisation and time-management
        skills are, also, equally beneficial to your non-sporting
        life. For those of you've who've read this far let me
        finish with another quote; <em>&quot;Everyone has the
        will to win, but not everyone has the will to practise&quot;</em>
        - profling and goal setting makes the best use of your
        available time to maximise the benefit from your practise
        time.</td>
