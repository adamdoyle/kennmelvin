<p class="LeadIn">There is a wealth of useful information on the
Internet. The Internet is a valuable tool for a coach, allowing
you to both search for and find up-to-date information and also
to keep in touch with players and other coaches. You should also
be careful not to believe everything you read on net. I've seen
several blatantly wrong statements go unchallenged and some
people will cheerfully <a href="netCds.htm">lead</a> you along
just for the fun.</p>

<p>See my <a href="klinks.htm">links</a> section for some
pointers. If you can't find anything to interest you there you

        former national coach John Williams in association with
        Dick Ritger. Several thousand have been certified. There
        is a minimum period of one year between achieving and
        sitting the next level. Phase I qualifies you take
        beginners through basic instructional technique. Phase I
        and II passes are called &quot;instructors&quot;. Having
        passed Phase III you will be called a coach, with a
        stronger understanding equipment selection and the mental
        game. Courses usually last two days with written tests
        being used at the end of the course to test learning.

        usual format with a test being administered at the Bronze
        &amp; Silver levels. Silver level is intended to take
        athletes to about the 190 level and requires the coach to
        demonstrate the ability to analyse athletes on video.
        Gold Level certification is a much more lengthy
        procedure, consisting of specific &quot;domains&quot; and
        &quot;competencies&quot; which the coach must provide
        evidence for award. Due to the detailed nature of the
        domains attaining Gold level is not a two-day process,
        but may easily take two years to complete the programme.<img

<p>I've collected together some interesting <a href="cAdmin.htm">articles</a>
published elsewhere on the Internet. I didn't write them, but
they appeal to me for some reason, be it their sarcasm or just
the underlying truth that makes them relevant.</p>

<h3>Ethics &amp; Values<br>
<img src="bgNavyH.JPG" width="80%" height="3"></h3>

<p>It is essential that governing bodies teach their coaches
ethical behaviour. It all comes down to trust: coaches are in a
position of power (even if they don't realise it) and athletes
trust their coach. Sadly, many coaches abuse that power and abuse
of youngsters is too common place. When the truth comes out, and
it does, it's no fun seeing your name in the newspapers or being
taken to court. Acting in your own self-interest, because &quot;everyone&quot;
else does it or in a way that inflicts harm brings your
reputation and your sport into the spotlight for the wrong
reasons. It happens and will continue to happen. </p>

<p>Difficult decisions have to be made and, at the highest level,
there is money and political interest on the line, the decisions
can be very hard. The IOC (International Olympic Committee) issue
guidelines that are so detailed that when printed the material is
over an inch thick, but problems still occur. Keep it simple and
Ethics can help you not only make the right decision in difficult
times but to form strong and lifelong character in the athletes
you work with.</p>

        <td>If you coach, with individuals or teams, you will
        face many challenges: overcoming these challenges can
        make you a better coach and a better person. Many people
        allow themselves to get angry and frustrated when they
        hit problems. There are some simple techniques for
        solving problems but, like any skill, they requre
        practise. Understand that people are different - try
        putting yourself in the other persons shoes, wear their
        &quot;hat&quot;. Try not to jump to conclusions, be
        judgemental or make assumptions - gather up all points of
        view and think &quot;win-win&quot;, find a solution that
        benefits all parties. In the most difficult problems let
