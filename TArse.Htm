        athletes in any sport are stronger and faster than their
        opponent. This advantage is, however, more than purely physical.
        Better bowlers accept that bowling is ALL about
        adjusting: when you accept the NEED to adjust you will
        enjoy your bowling better and not only recognise when to
        change but actually make the changes faster than your
        opponents.</td>

        <strong>This short section will discuss the key
        adjustments you need to be able to make</strong>. Now, if
        you just bowl leagues in one bowling centre you may get
        the same high-scoring condition each week: you can use
        the same ball, same line, same speed each week and never
        really need to make any drastic changes. If, however, you
        venture on to the tournament circuit and bowl in
        different centres with different conditions you have a
        choice: fight the lane and try your same-old-style or
        make a move to find the optimum shot. So what do you want
        to do? If your choice is to accept the need for
        adjustments please read on...</td>

<p><font size="4"><strong>O</strong></font><strong>il </strong>is
put down on the lanes to create a condition which protects the
lanes but, during play, the oil moves around - changes. So what
do you do? <a href="TComplai.Htm">Complain</a>, yes you can do
that but it will do no good - the oil has already changed and
your opponent will see you getting frustrated and know that your <a
href="TMental.Htm">Mental Game</a> is slipping, to their
advantage. If, as in league and tournament play, your opponent is
playing on the same pair of lanes that's about as fair as it can
get isn't it? So what what do you do? You don't complain, instead
you use your knowledge to make an adjustment...</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>A</strong></font><strong>djustments:</strong>
you can move left, half a board or ten boards, change your
target, change your speed, change your ball - where does it ever
stop? I teach four key adjustments all summed up in a nice
acronym that <em>Susie Minshew</em> coined in one of her
articles. If you want to increase your ability to remember the
memory-men teach us to associate a word with a picture (mental
imagery/visualisation) so get ready for one of the easiest to
remember acronyms I'ver heard...</p>

<p align="left">So when you start to struggle, when you can't
carry strikes as well as you did at the start of the game, don't
panic but recognise that the lane is changing and you need to
adjust: remember your ARSE and you have four things you can
change straight away to create a better shot. Four key
adjustments which should help you in any situation. Fred Borden
is adding Loft to his <a href="CBooks.Htm">Knowledge is the Key</a>
2000 work so maybe, if you subscribe to that idea, you can think
of &quot;ARSEnL&quot;.</p>

        <td valign="top"><strong>Usually, during the course of a
        game, the ball will lift oil off the lane, or push it
        further down.</strong> This means that your
        &quot;line&quot; to the pocket will dry up and your ball
        will hook earlier (more friction between it and the
        lane). A simple move is make a slight move left with your
        feet (left-handers reverse this process) to create some
        more swing. You change the shape (angle) of your line to
        the pocket. You can make a parallel move left, to get
        your ball back in some fresh oil. These are
        &quot;bumps&quot;, when you've bumped left enough,
        though, you may hit a dried out line created by another
        bowler - you then need to &quot;jump&quot; left, i.e.
        instead of tweaking your line a board or two, you jump
        five-ten-fifteen boards left. <p>But then what do you do
        when you've moved as far left as you can? Simple,
        remember your ARSE - you've still got three more
        adjustments. </p>

        the ball down the lane and stronger hook.</strong> In the
        days of reactive-resin coverstocks fewer people employ
        this, preferring to let the ball roll off their palm for
        a 45-degree rotation which creates a strong but more
        controlled hook. On heavier oil where the ball skids
        longer and doesn't move into a hook/roll use less
        rotation, bringing your hand more up the back of the
        ball.</td>

        <td valign="top"><strong>On drier lanes delivering the
        ball with more speed will help it get further down the
        lane before it reacts to hook into the pins.</strong>
        Watch racing drivers, they slow down in the rain (on wet
        conditions): why? Because there's less friction. Your
        ball needs friction to hook and roll. So, on oilier lanes
        a slower ball will help create the earlier reaction you
        need to stop your ball sliding all the way. Remember the
        skid-hook-roll pattern: if you throw a hook ball and it
        is not moved out of the skid and into the roll you will
        not carry the strikes you need to win.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" class="hdrRow"><font color="#000000"><strong>E</strong></font>quipment</td>
        <td valign="top"><strong>To adjust your Rotation or Speed
        requires skill and practise. </strong>As with golf it can
        be easier to choose the correct equipment: on oily lanes
        you need more friction so choose a ball with a duller
        surface and later, when it dries out, go to a shinier
        ball (less friction will help it get down the lane).
        Since Reactive ball came on the scene the old static
        weight have become less important. Matching the ball to
        the condition is not that hard, though the manufacturers
        can easily confuse you with complex terminology. </td>
